# Current State and Operational Roadmap

## Purpose

This document is the implementation companion to `PLATFORM_MASTER_PLAN.md`.
It records what is implemented by the platform at this point in the build and
what remains in the agreed sequence.

Snapshot for this refresh:

- date: **2026-08-28**;
- implementation state: **Stages 1–9 implemented on the Stage 9 integration
  branch**;
- next sustained stage after merge: **Stage 10 — Commercial and analytics**.

Credential-specific security and operational rules are defined in
`CREDENTIAL_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`. Stage 9 cross-domain behavior is defined in
`UNIFIED_OPERATIONAL_SEARCH_ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`UNIFIED_OPERATIONAL_POLISH_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 1. Repository/application foundation

### Implemented

- [x] One shared Django backend is the business-data/auth/scope authority.
- [x] Django Ninja is the API layer.
- [x] PostgreSQL/Redis/Celery foundations are established.
- [x] ADB Software Solutions, ADB Web Designs and ADB Technology are
      first-class Brands.
- [x] ADB Software Solutions public + `/admin` routes share one Next.js app.
- [x] Authentication/account security is a separate Next.js application.
- [x] Django session/TOTP/WebAuthn/passkey flows remain authoritative.
- [x] Tailwind CSS is the frontend styling standard.
- [x] The operations workspace is dark-only and workflow-oriented.
- [x] Brand-aware CMS/public content isolation exists.
- [x] Append-only AuditEvent infrastructure exists with explicit Client/resource
      context where relevant.
- [x] Deterministic development seeding and repository CI/devcontainer tooling
      exist.

## 2. Platform-wide operational UX rules

### Implemented direction

- [x] Active/current/actionable records are the default in operational domains.
- [x] History is retained behind explicit filters/views rather than deleted.
- [x] Shared right-side Task/Record drawer patterns preserve list/workspace
      context.
- [x] Full-page deep links remain available for refresh/bookmark/complex work.
- [x] Data-heavy operational pages use server-side pagination/filtering/sorting
      and statistics where implemented.
- [x] Client/Internal ownership is a first-class platform rule.
- [x] Django capability + scope remains authoritative regardless of frontend
      visibility.
- [x] Cross-device preferences such as Ticket Queue defaults and Dashboard
      layout are server-backed.

### Continue applying

- [ ] Keep commercial records and later portal/admin surfaces current-first
      where lifecycle/history makes that meaningful.
- [ ] Keep new cross-domain features as projections over authoritative domain
      services rather than parallel sources of truth.

## 3. Clients and Contacts

### Implemented

- [x] Client create/edit lifecycle management.
- [x] Active/Inactive/Archived Client lifecycle and Active-first global view.
- [x] Client statistics, filtering and server-side pagination.
- [x] Client records can open in a right-side record drawer.
- [x] ClientContact create/edit/deactivate and Primary/Billing/Technical roles.
- [x] Contact workspaces expose Contact-specific Tickets.
- [x] Client/Contact email identity participates in Ticket sender resolution.
- [x] Client Command Centre provides coherent Overview/Contacts/Projects/Tasks/
      Tickets/Time/Infrastructure/Credentials/Knowledge/Activity navigation.
- [x] Client Command Centre is current-first, permission-aware and provides
      selected-period Time summaries and contextual create/deep-link actions.
- [x] Client Activity can use explicit scoped AuditEvent context rather than
      relying on unsafe metadata inference.

### Later

- [ ] Add commercial history during Stage 10 without turning the Client
      workspace into an unstructured catch-all page.

## 4. CRM / Leads

### Implemented

- [x] Lead create/edit/detail/workspace.
- [x] Lead ownership/assignment and explicit open/won/lost outcomes.
- [x] My active/open Leads default with Unassigned/All Active alternatives.
- [x] Won/Lost/All Leads history views.
- [x] Server-side Lead statistics, filtering and pagination.
- [x] Lead records can open/edit in a right-side drawer.
- [x] Website contact submissions create Leads and canonical Tickets.
- [x] Matching inbound/outbound Ticket communication appears on Leads.
- [x] Lead email sends through configured Microsoft 365 Shared Mailboxes and
      the Ticket/Graph layer.
- [x] Lead -> Client + primary Contact conversion retains communication history.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] Stronger manual contact matching/deduplication where sender matching is
      insufficient.
- [ ] Commercial value/follow-up metadata belongs in Stage 10 rather than a
      duplicate CRM-side commercial model.

## 5. Projects

### Implemented

- [x] Client/Internal Project ownership and lifecycle.
- [x] Current global Project views default to Planning/Active/Paused.
- [x] Completed/Archived/All are explicit history views.
- [x] Work-first Project workspace with Work, Timeline, Overview and Time.
- [x] Project List/Board surfaces with contextual Task creation and ordering.
- [x] Dependency-aware Project Timeline with Day/Week/Month zoom.
- [x] Dated Subtasks and dependency connector/blocked state.
- [x] Project Time ledger with tracked/billable/non-billable totals.
- [x] Project context can be reused by first-class Calendar Events.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] Project participants/ownership only if real collaboration workflows need
      more than current assignment/context.
- [ ] Richer commercial context arrives in Stage 10.

## 6. Tasks / ADB work management

### Implemented

- [x] Tasks may be standalone Internal, Client-owned or Project-owned.
- [x] My Tasks default plus Today, Upcoming, Overdue, Completed and All Tasks.
- [x] Server-authoritative counts for focus views.
- [x] Quick capture with ownership context and due-date shortcuts.

- [x] Task comments/discussion and completion/reopen controls.
- [x] Embedded live timer and Task time history.
- [x] Assigned overdue Tasks participate in scoped operational notifications.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] Agree long-term delete/archive semantics if completion/history proves
      insufficient.
- [ ] Explicit Ticket-linked Tasks only after the workflow is intentionally
      designed.

## 7. Calendar / planning

### Implemented

- [x] Permission-aware Calendar API/workspace.
- [x] Dated Task and Project work appears on the Calendar.
- [x] First-class `CalendarEvent` model for Events, Meetings, Milestones and
      Reminders.
- [x] Calendar Events support Internal/Client ownership and optional Project
      context.
- [x] Timed/all-day ranges, status, location, meeting URL and attendee email
      metadata are supported.
- [x] Event create/update/delete actions are backend-authorised and scoped.
- [x] Upcoming Events can participate in operational notifications.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] External calendar integration only after explicit provider, ownership and
      conflict-resolution design.
- [ ] Add richer day/week planning only if real usage justifies the additional
      UI complexity.

## 8. Time Tracking

### Implemented

- [x] Manual Time Entries.
- [x] Client/Internal ownership with Internal time forced non-billable.
- [x] Project/Task/Ticket attribution and valid direct Client context.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] Edit/delete Time Entries with clear permission/audit policy.
- [ ] Richer staff breakdown/reporting where useful.
- [ ] Stage 10 invoice/commercial linkage without making invoicing a dependency
      of operational Time Tracking.

## 9. Ticketing and communications

### Implemented

- [x] TicketQueue, Ticket, TicketMessage, TicketNote and TicketAttachment.
- [x] Client + Ticket Queue capability/scope enforcement.
- [x] My Tickets default plus Unassigned, All Active, Queue and history views.
- [x] Server-backed per-user default Ticket Queues.
- [x] Ticket records can open in a shared right-side drawer.
- [x] Internal Notes merge chronologically into the conversation feed.
- [x] Graph connection/Shared Mailbox configuration and verification.
- [x] Certificate/client-secret app-only Graph support.
- [x] Persisted delta sync/cursors and worker locking.

### Remaining/refinement

- [ ] Harden the rare ambiguous-send case where Graph accepts mail but the
      worker loses the provider response before local persistence.
- [ ] Richer Task/KB/Infrastructure links only where normal workflows benefit.

## 10. Microsoft 365 deployment model

### Established architecture

- [x] One tenant/app-level MicrosoftGraphConnection can serve many Shared
      Mailboxes.
- [x] Production prefers certificate-based app-only authentication.
- [x] Exchange Online RBAC for Applications is the Microsoft-side mailbox
      boundary.
- [x] Enabled database Mailbox rows are the narrower operational allow-list.
- [x] Licensed user mailboxes are not intended Ticket sources.
- [x] Graph private-key/certificate material can use the encrypted Credential
      Vault rather than duplicate plaintext fields.
- [x] Preferred ADB Exchange management scope dynamically includes Shared
      Mailboxes so new Shared Mailboxes do not need a new RBAC assignment.

See `MICROSOFT_GRAPH_TICKETING_SETUP.md` and
`CREDENTIAL_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## 11. Infrastructure

### Implemented

- [x] `InfrastructureResource` common identity and Client/Internal ownership.

- [x] Docker/Kubernetes, storage/backups, system services and scheduled-job
      specialist technical operations.
- [x] Bounded permission-aware resource topology traversal/workspace.

## 12. Credential Vault

### Implemented

- [x] StoredCredential Client/Internal ownership.
- [x] Typed credential templates for common secret types.
- [x] Encrypted, versioned secret payload service and MultiFernet key ring.
- [x] Active/Inactive/Archived lifecycle and Active-first views.
- [x] Searchable non-secret metadata only.
- [x] Permission-aware secure CRUD and separate reveal/copy/download actions.

- [x] Encryption fails closed when key-ring configuration is invalid.
- [x] Optional per-Credential rotation intervals.
- [x] Metadata-only Credential expiry/rotation health workspace.
- [x] Scoped expiry/rotation operational reminders.

### Later Vault work

- [ ] Remove reconciled legacy plaintext columns when production migration is
      verified.
- [ ] Bulk encryption-key rotation tooling/reporting.

- [x] Filesystem-like folder/section tree.
- [x] Document read/workspace experience and Markdown editing.
- [x] Immutable versions with author/editor context.
- [x] Protected attachments.
- [x] Tags/search metadata and permission-aware search foundations.
- [x] Infrastructure and Credential metadata links without secret duplication.
- [x] Client/resource contextual navigation.
- [x] Future portal visibility remains explicit and private by default.

## 14. Monitoring

### Implemented

- [x] Monitor checks attached to structured resources.
- [x] ICMP, TCP, HTTP/HTTPS, content, TLS, DNS and domain-expiry checks.
- [x] Schedules/timeouts/failure/recovery thresholds/severity.
- [x] Historical results and failure->recovery incidents.
- [x] Celery Beat/worker execution through reusable services.
- [x] Current-first global, Client and resource technical-health views.
- [x] Active incidents participate in scoped operational notifications.

### Deliberate boundary

- [ ] Authenticated Monitoring remains deferred until explicit authentication
      schemes are modelled; Credential type is not used to guess wire auth.

## 15. Users & Access

### Implemented

- [x] Django Groups/Permissions plus StaffAccessProfile capability/scope model.
- [x] Active-first staff list/detail and invitation lifecycle.
- [x] Group bundles plus additive direct business capabilities.
- [x] Client and Ticket Queue scope administration.
- [x] Server-backed default Ticket Queue preferences.
- [x] Effective capability/source display including sensitive capabilities.

- [x] Self/superuser safeguards and rejection of unsafe framework Groups.
- [x] Routine staff administration without requiring Django superuser access.

## 16. Dashboard / My Work

### Implemented

- [x] Per-user server-persisted layout/configuration.
- [x] Configurable ordering and 4/6/8/12-column widths.
- [x] My Tasks, My Tickets, Time, Leads, Projects, Technical Health, Agenda and
      personal Recent Activity widgets.
- [x] Live capabilities and normal domain scopes are reapplied on every load.
- [x] Saved widgets disappear from the effective layout immediately after
      permission loss.
- [x] No browser-persisted Dashboard layout and no Credential secret projection.

## 17. Search, Activity, notifications and SLA polish

### Implemented in Stage 9

- [x] Unified permission-aware global search.
- [x] Client-context search across mature operational domains.
- [x] Ticket message-text discovery without returning message bodies in search
      projections.
- [x] Metadata-only Credential search; decrypted/legacy/encrypted secret values
      are never indexed or returned.
- [x] Search input uses CSRF-aware POST body rather than URL query strings.
- [x] Explicit Client/resource AuditEvent context.
- [x] Permission-aware operational Activity workspace.
- [x] Sensitive audit request metadata hidden without explicit capability.
- [x] Audit acknowledgement appends history rather than mutating original
      events.
- [x] Bounded Infrastructure topology/navigation polish.
- [x] Server-backed per-user operational notifications.
- [x] Notifications cover overdue assigned Tasks, assigned Ticket SLA health,
      Credential health, Monitoring incidents and upcoming Calendar Events.
- [x] Credential expiry/rotation health and reminders.
- [x] Ticket SLA/escalation refinement with Queue policy editing.
- [x] First-class Calendar Event/Meeting/Milestone/Reminder behavior.

PostgreSQL/database-backed bounded search remains appropriate initially; do not
add dedicated search infrastructure without demonstrated need.

## 18. Commercial and analytics layer

### Stage 10 — agreed future scope, not implemented yet

- [ ] Products/services catalogue.
- [ ] Recurring services.
- [ ] Quotes/proposals.
- [ ] Contracts.
- [ ] Invoices/billing.
- [ ] Stripe/payment tracking.
- [ ] Profitability reporting.
- [ ] Client lifetime value.
- [ ] Time-versus-pay/revenue analysis.
- [ ] Lead-source conversion and revenue attribution.

Detailed signing/accounting/tax/retainer/forecasting models are not yet agreed
and should not be invented during unrelated implementation work.

## 19. Public websites

### Foundation implemented

- [x] Brand-aware CMS/public API isolation.
- [x] Contact-form Brand/source ingestion into Lead + Ticket pipeline.
- [x] Separate public Next.js applications exist.

### Primary build focus deferred to Stage 11

- [ ] Complete each Brand's public experience after Stage 10 commercial
      contracts are stable enough not to be repeatedly redesigned underneath it.

Security/fix/integration work may still happen opportunistically.

## 20. Client portal

### Deferred to Stage 12

- [ ] Design explicit portal identity link to ClientContact.
- [ ] Design per-domain portal visibility.
- [ ] Expose only deliberately Client-visible Tickets/Projects/Documents/etc.
- [ ] Never expose Internal resources, Credential secrets, Ticket Notes or
      staff-only audit/security data implicitly.

## 21. Current ordered implementation sequence

1. **Core typed Infrastructure — implemented.**
2. **Web Infrastructure — implemented.**
3. **Monitoring + technical dashboards — implemented.**
4. **Knowledge Base redesign + resource links/search foundations — implemented.**
5. **Specialist technical operations — implemented.**
6. **Client Command Centre integration — implemented.**
7. **Users & Access — implemented.**
8. **Dashboard / My Work — implemented.**
9. **Unified operational polish — implemented.**
10. **Commercial + analytics layer — next.**
11. **Public websites as primary focus.**
12. **Client portal.**

Small dependency-driven slices may move, but major order changes should update
`PLATFORM_MASTER_PLAN.md` and this checklist.

## 22. Internal-platform readiness gate

The operational platform now satisfies the agreed pre-commercial readiness gate
for Stages 1–9:

- [x] Clients/Contacts managed through the custom UI.
- [x] Leads and tracked communication usable day to day.
- [x] Projects/Tasks/Time usable as ADB's work-management system.
- [x] Ticketing/Graph mail usable as the communication system.
- [x] Infrastructure/Credentials/Knowledge usable as the technical
      documentation system.
- [x] Monitoring surfaces current technical health.
- [x] Client Command Centre exposes major operational context.
- [x] Users & Access is safe and usable.
- [x] Dashboard/My Work is materially useful.
- [x] Cross-domain search/navigation/activity/notifications are coherent and
      permission-aware.
- [x] CI/security/dependency health remains part of the merge gate.

The next sustained implementation phase is Stage 10 commercial and analytics.
The public websites remain Stage 11 and the Client portal follows only after
internal/commercial visibility rules are mature.
