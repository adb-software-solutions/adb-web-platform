# Infrastructure, Credentials, Knowledge and Monitoring Architecture

## Purpose

This document defines the technical-operations architecture for the ADB
Business Platform. Read it with:

- `PLATFORM_MASTER_PLAN.md`;
- `PERMISSIONS_AND_ACCESS_MODEL.md`;
- `DOMAIN_MODEL_AUDIT.md`;
- `CURRENT_STATE_AND_FOUNDATION_CHECKLIST.md`;
- `CREDENTIAL_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

The target is an IT Glue-style workspace for software development, web
delivery, DevOps, Linux/system administration and technical support.

It is **not** a generic asset table and it is not a set of disconnected CRUD
registers. The product goal is contextual technical navigation: from a resource,
an authorised operator should be able to understand what it is, who owns it,
what it depends on, what depends on it, how it is accessed, how it is monitored
and where its documentation lives.

---

## 1. Structured resource architecture

Technical records use a shared `InfrastructureResource` identity plus strongly
typed specialist records.

Conceptually:

```text
InfrastructureResource
├── Server / compute
├── Network resource
├── Database instance / logical database
├── Application / Application Environment
├── Website / endpoint
├── Domain / DNS / TLS
├── Kubernetes / container resources
├── Provider Account
├── storage / backup / service / scheduled job
└── other useful specialist families
```

`InfrastructureResource` owns cross-cutting identity/ownership/lifecycle. It
does not replace specialist relational models with EAV, arbitrary JSON or a
graph database.

Specialist models keep fields/invariants that belong to their technical domain.
The shared resource identity exists so cross-cutting systems can attach
consistently:

- Credentials;
- Knowledge Base documents;
- Monitoring checks/incidents;
- tags;
- Activity/audit context;
- generic technical relationships;
- search/topology/navigation.

---

## 2. Ownership

Every structured resource is deliberately:

```text
client-owned -> a real Client
internal     -> ADB itself, Client is null
```

Never create a fake ADB/Internal Client.

Validation must enforce:

- client-owned resources require a Client;
- Internal resources do not reference a Client;
- two resources owned by different Clients cannot have a direct generic
  relationship;
- Internal ADB resources may relate to Client resources where a genuine shared
  dependency exists.

Valid examples:

```text
Client Website -> hosted_on -> Internal ADB Server
Client Domain  -> managed_by -> Internal Cloudflare Provider Account
```

A future Client portal must not expose Internal resource details merely because
an Internal resource relates to a Client resource.

---

## 3. Capability and scope

Infrastructure follows the platform rule:

```text
Django capability + ownership scope
```

Authorised staff may access Internal resources according to Infrastructure
capability. Client-owned resources additionally require access to the owning
Client.

This applies to:

- collections;
- details/drawers;
- Client-context Infrastructure views;
- relationship selectors and mutations;
- reconciliation;
- specialist projections;
- Credentials/KB/Monitoring panels;
- search/topology.

Denied records are removed at service/queryset level. Frontend filtering is not
an access-control mechanism.

Credential metadata and secret actions add their own independent capability
boundary on top of Infrastructure visibility; seeing a Server does not grant
permission to reveal its linked password or SSH key. See
`CREDENTIAL_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

---

## 4. `InfrastructureResource`

The shared resource record carries cross-cutting fields such as:

- Client/Internal ownership;
- name;
- resource type;
- lifecycle;
- environment;
- criticality;
- safe description;
- tags;
- creator/updater metadata;
- archive/create/update timestamps;
- future explicit portal-visibility metadata, private by default.

Normal operational views are **current-first**. Retired/Archived resources are
history and should not dominate the default register or Client context.

---

## 5. Strongly typed specialists

Prefer explicit relational fields for known semantics.

Examples:

- a logical Database belongs to/uses a Database Instance through a real
  relation;
- a self-hosted Database Instance may run on a Server;
- an Application Environment belongs to an Application;
- a Website endpoint may reference an Application Environment;
- a Kubernetes Namespace belongs to a Cluster;
- a repository/source relationship should carry an explicit role when useful.

Generic `ResourceRelationship` edges complement these known relationships. They
do not replace good specialist modelling.

Secret material is never a specialist-field concern. Specialist records link to
Vault Credentials rather than adding password/token/private-key columns.

### Implemented compute/network specialist boundary

The first native specialist family is implemented without renaming or deleting
the still-live legacy `Server` model.

`ServerProfile` is therefore the transitional modern compute model attached
one-to-one to a Server `InfrastructureResource`. It carries operational fields
such as hostname/FQDN, purpose/role, compute type, architecture, CPU/RAM/disk,
OS/kernel metadata, Provider Account/provider resource identifiers,
region/zone/datacentre, virtualisation, SSH port, timezone, patch/update policy
and commission/decommission dates.

Networking is represented by typed models rather than free-text Server fields:

- `Network` for VPC/LAN/VLAN/VPN/overlay/public network context;
- `Subnet` for CIDR/gateway/VLAN/AZ/purpose under a Network;
- `NetworkInterface` for Server interface/MAC/MTU/network/subnet membership;
- `IPAddress` for IPv4/IPv6 address/scope/primary/PTR metadata attached to a
  structured resource and optionally an interface.

The models validate resource type, Client/Internal boundaries, Network/Subnet
consistency, gateway/CIDR membership and IP/interface/subnet membership.
Provider/account relationships are explicit and never inferred from a legacy
provider label.

Specialist create/edit/archive APIs use the canonical `InfrastructureResource`
ID in their URL/API identity. Invalid specialist creation is atomic and must not
leave an orphan shared resource. Archive is a shared resource lifecycle change,
not hard deletion.

The resource workspace projects safe native specialist metadata and falls back
to the legacy specialist projection only where a native replacement does not yet
exist. Linked active Credentials are already surfaced from the Vault through the
same resource identity.

### Implemented Web/Domain/DNS/TLS specialist boundary

Web infrastructure is now represented by native typed specialists rather than
comma-separated legacy metadata:

- `WebsiteProfile` represents the logical web property and explicit hosting/CDN/WAF Provider Accounts;
- `WebsiteEndpoint` represents a concrete URL and may link to its `ApplicationEnvironment`, `DomainProfile` and `TLSCertificate`;
- `DomainProfile` records deterministic registration/status/expiry information and an optional registrar Provider Account;
- `DNSZone` belongs to a Domain and may reference its DNS Provider Account;
- `DNSRecord` stores structured authoritative record data including TTL and MX/SRV/proxy/provider metadata;
- `TLSCertificate` stores non-secret certificate metadata only;
- `TLSCertificateDomain` records typed Domain coverage and primary-name context.

The shared Resource workspace exposes nested Website Endpoint, DNS Record and TLS Domain-coverage operations so these relationships are usable without returning to flat specialist registers. Normal selectors are permission-scoped and enforce the same Client/Internal boundaries as direct API mutations.

Private keys, certificate bundles, DNS/API tokens and registrar credentials are not fields on these models. They remain encrypted Vault Credentials linked to the relevant Website/Domain/Provider/TLS resource.

---

## 6. Generic resource relationships

`ResourceRelationship` supplies the cross-domain topology graph without a graph
database.

Relationship semantics include concepts such as:

- `depends_on`;
- `hosted_on`;
- `connects_to`;
- `managed_by`;
- `backed_up_to`;
- `protected_by`;
- `routes_to`;
- `uses`;
- `contains`;
- `related_to`.

Relationships are directed, may carry human context, and must enforce:

- no self-link;
- no duplicate equivalent relationship;
- target visibility;
- Client ownership boundaries.

The graph should ultimately support useful contextual/topology views such as:

```text
Website
  -> Application Environment
  -> Application
  -> Server/Provider Account
  -> Database
  -> Domain/DNS/TLS
  -> Monitoring
  -> Credentials
  -> Knowledge/runbooks
```

---

## 7. Providers and Provider Accounts

Provider identity is data, not a hard-coded choice list.

`ServiceProvider` represents organisations/services such as DigitalOcean, AWS,
Microsoft, Cloudflare, GitHub, Hetzner, registrars and other vendors.

`ProviderAccount` represents the actual account/tenant/project used by ADB or a
Client and is resource-backed so Credentials, Knowledge, Monitoring and
relationships attach consistently.

Safe account metadata may include:

- account/customer ID;
- tenant/project ID;
- portal URL;
- default region;
- support plan;
- billing/reference identifiers.

Passwords, API tokens, client secrets and private keys never belong directly on
ProviderAccount. They are stored in the Credential Vault and linked to the
Provider Account resource.

---

## 8. Legacy specialist reconciliation

The repository contains older flat specialist models including Server,
Database, Website, Domain, SSLCertificate, Licence, Application, MobileApp, API,
Bot and EmailSystem.

These rows are preserved while the structured model becomes the operational
identity.

### Implemented transition model

Every current legacy family has a typed one-to-one identity bridge to
`InfrastructureResource`.

The bridge enforces resource-type compatibility: a legacy Server reconciles
only to a resource whose type is Server, a legacy Website only to Website, and
so on.

Reconciliation is explicit/operator-driven. The system does **not** guess
Client/Internal ownership from historical data.

The operator chooses/validates:

- ownership type;
- Client when Client-owned;
- resource name;
- lifecycle;
- environment;
- criticality.

The dedicated `reconcile_legacy_infrastructure` permission protects this
migration operation. Normal Client scope still applies.

Each legacy row is reconciled only once.

### Safe specialist projection and promotion

During transition, structured resource detail may project safe specialist
metadata from the legacy record.

Reconciled legacy Servers additionally promote deterministic safe compute/IP
facts into `ServerProfile`/`IPAddress`. Legacy Database/Application rows likewise
promote only deterministic typed fields. Reconciled legacy Websites create a
`WebsiteProfile` and primary Endpoint from the exact primary URL; Domains promote
the exact name/expiry/auto-renew values; legacy SSL rows promote non-secret TLS
metadata and link to a Domain only when that Domain has already been explicitly
reconciled.

Promotion deliberately does not infer Provider Accounts from legacy provider/registrar/CDN strings, parse comma-separated aliases or nameservers into new topology, infer ownership, or copy general free-text notes. The legacy identity bridge remains intact for provenance while the native specialist becomes the operational representation.

Secret-bearing legacy fields such as licence keys, passwords/API material and
general sensitive notes must not leak through the structured resource API.
Where those values are migrated, the target is an encrypted Vault Credential,
not another Infrastructure metadata field.

The workspace retains provenance/back-links while the bridge remains useful.

### Migration discipline

1. preserve historical migrations;
2. preserve legacy rows/model identity;
3. do not guess ownership;
4. add/keep typed identity bridges;
5. make the structured resource the operational relationship anchor once
   reconciled;
6. introduce mature specialist CRUD progressively;
7. migrate secret-bearing legacy values into the Credential Vault before
   removing duplicate plaintext fields;
8. retire duplicated legacy fields only after structured replacements are
   migrated and verified.

---

## 9. Credential integration

Credentials are an implemented, separate security boundary attached to
resources rather than plaintext fields embedded in Infrastructure.

The authoritative Vault design is `CREDENTIAL_VAULT_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

### Resource links

A Credential may link to one or more Infrastructure resources with purpose and
primary semantics.

Examples:

```text
SSH Credential       -> Server
Database Login       -> Database + Application Environment
Cloudflare API Token -> Provider Account + managed Domains
Kubeconfig            -> Kubernetes Cluster
Certificate Keypair  -> TLS/Endpoint resource
```

Client-owned Credentials may link only to resources owned by that same Client.
Internal Credentials may link to Internal or Client resources where this
represents a real shared ADB operational credential.

### Security rules

- ordinary APIs/search return credential metadata only;
- secret values remain in the encrypted, versioned credential payload;
- `CREDENTIAL_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` supplies the ordered MultiFernet key ring;
- reveal/copy/download are explicit separately permissioned actions;
- audit records field/context only, never the secret value;
- revealed browser values are ephemeral and are not persisted to local/session
  storage, routes or normal application caches;
- Infrastructure must reference Credentials instead of duplicating plaintext
  secrets;
- missing/invalid encryption configuration fails closed.

### Implemented workspace integration

- `/admin/credentials` is Active-first with explicit history views;
- typed create/edit forms use credential-template schemas;
- Client workspaces surface active Client-owned Credentials;
- Infrastructure Resource workspaces surface linked active Credentials;
- legacy StoredCredential plaintext values can be atomically reconciled into
  the encrypted payload before legacy columns are removed later.

---

## 10. Knowledge Base integration

Structured resources and Knowledge documents are distinct but deeply linked.

The agreed KB direction is a Client/Internal filesystem-like documentation tree
with Markdown/controlled rich text, versions and secure attachments.

A document/resource relationship may express semantics such as:

- documentation;
- runbook;
- deployment procedure;
- troubleshooting;
- architecture;
- disaster recovery;
- restore procedure;
- configuration.

A mature Resource workspace should surface linked documentation. A KB document
should surface related resources.

The KB must not become an alternative plaintext password store. Sensitive
access material belongs in the Credential Vault; documentation can link to the
Credential record without embedding its secret value.

---

## 11. Monitoring architecture

Monitoring is a separate cross-cutting subsystem attached to Resources. It must
not be represented by a single `is_up` field on Server or Website.

Initial target check types:

- ICMP/ping;
- TCP port;
- HTTP/HTTPS;
- expected/forbidden text/regex;
- TLS certificate validity/expiry;
- DNS record checks;
- domain registration expiry.

Checks carry scheduling, timeout, failure/recovery thresholds and severity.
Historical results record observations; Incidents represent meaningful
failure-to-recovery periods.

Celery Beat/workers execute due checks through reusable monitoring services.

The Monitoring UI should follow the platform's current-first rule:

- open incidents and unhealthy resources first;
- healthy history available but not dominant;
- global and Client-scoped health views;
- uptime/response history;
- expiring domain/TLS alerts.

If a check needs authentication, it references an encrypted Vault Credential.
Monitoring result/history records never copy the secret into their metadata.

Detailed retention/escalation/notification schema should be decided in the
Monitoring slice rather than guessed now.

---

## 12. Target specialist families

### Compute and networking

Implemented foundation:

- Servers/VMs/bare-metal/container hosts through `ServerProfile`;
- network interfaces/IP addresses;
- networks/VPCs/VLANs/subnets/VPNs;
- Provider Account links and Client/Internal boundary validation.

Later networking specialists may add firewall/load-balancer/network-device
records where they are operationally useful.

### Applications and source

Implemented foundation:

- logical Applications through `ApplicationProfile`;
- resource-backed `ApplicationEnvironment` records for deploy/runtime/release context;
- resource-backed `SourceRepository` records with Provider Account metadata;
- typed `ApplicationRepositoryLink` role/path relationships;
- Client/Internal boundary validation and resource-centric create/edit/archive APIs;
- Credentials remain Vault references rather than fields on these specialists.

Later application specialists may add richer API/background-service/bot/mobile and technology/version relationships where operationally useful.

### Databases

Implemented foundation:

- `DatabaseInstance` for managed/self-hosted service context;
- `LogicalDatabase` as an explicit child of a Database Instance;
- Server/Provider/endpoint/port/TLS/HA/replica/backup/maintenance metadata;
- Client/Internal boundary validation and resource-centric create/edit/archive APIs;
- authentication material through linked Vault Credentials, never specialist secret fields.

### Web, domains and TLS

- Websites/endpoints;
- Domains;
- DNS Zones/Records where useful;
- TLS Certificates;
- registrar/DNS/CDN/WAF Provider Account relationships;
- administrative credentials/keypairs by Vault reference.

### Containers and Kubernetes

- Docker/Podman/container stacks/services;
- Kubernetes Clusters;
- Namespaces;
- workloads;
- Services/Ingresses;
- Helm releases;
- persistent storage links;
- kubeconfigs/service tokens/certificates through Vault Credentials.

Document the useful operational shape without manually cloning the Kubernetes
API into Django.

### Operations

- storage resources;
- backup plans;
- system services;
- scheduled jobs/cron/systemd timers;
- licences/subscriptions;
- email systems and other useful operational configuration.

## 13. Resource workspace UX

Mature resource workspaces should converge on a recognisable pattern:

```text
Resource
├── Overview / technical details
├── Relationships
├── Credentials
├── Monitoring
├── Knowledge / Documentation
└── Activity
```

Overview remains specialist-specific. Cross-cutting sections use the shared
resource identity.

Native Server/Network/Subnet, Database/Logical Database, Application/Environment and Source Repository technical details are rendered directly in the shared Resource workspace alongside active linked Credentials. Application workspaces also surface typed Source Repository links separately from the generic topology graph. Reconciled resources retain their legacy-source provenance/back-link during migration.

The Credentials section is backed by the Vault's scoped resource-link API and
retains independent secret-action permissions.

Normal clicks may open resources in the shared right-side Record drawer while
full-page deep links remain available.

Client workspaces should expose Client-scoped Infrastructure/Credentials/KB/
Monitoring through the same policies as the global modules.

---

## 14. Search and topology

Global and Client-context search should cover useful non-secret metadata such
as:

- resource names;
- hostnames/IPs;
- domains/URLs;
- provider identifiers;
- technology metadata;
- tags;
- linked KB metadata;
- credential metadata only.

PostgreSQL-backed search is acceptable initially. Dedicated search/graph
infrastructure should not be introduced until scale/quality justifies it.

Search never indexes decrypted Vault secrets and never bypasses normal scope.

---

## 15. Current implemented boundary

The technical foundation now provides:

- `InfrastructureResource`;
- tags;
- `ServiceProvider`;
- resource-backed `ProviderAccount`;
- `ResourceRelationship`;
- ownership/cross-Client validation;
- current-first global/Client resource collections;
- scoped resource detail/drawer workspaces;
- relationship target/options/create/delete APIs/UI;
- typed identity bridges for every current legacy specialist family;
- explicit permission-aware legacy reconciliation;
- safe legacy specialist projection/provenance;
- deterministic reconciled legacy Server -> `ServerProfile`/`IPAddress`
  promotion without provider/ownership guessing;
- native `ServerProfile`, `Network`, `Subnet`, `NetworkInterface` and
  `IPAddress` specialist models;
- resource-centric create/edit/archive APIs for Server/Network/Subnet plus
  interface/IP management;
- native safe specialist projections in the Resource workspace;
- deterministic development seed data for structured compute/network examples;
- native `DatabaseInstance`, `LogicalDatabase`, `ApplicationProfile`, `ApplicationEnvironment` and `SourceRepository` specialists;
- typed `ApplicationRepositoryLink` role/path relationships;
- resource-centric create/edit/archive APIs and scoped selectors for the data/application specialist family;
- deterministic safe legacy Database/Application promotion without Provider Account, Server or free-text guessing;
- deterministic Internal and Client-owned development seed data for databases, applications, environments and source repositories;
- the typed encrypted Credential Vault;
- Credential -> Infrastructure Resource links with ownership validation;
- Client and Resource contextual Credential registers;
- explicit reveal/copy/download audit boundaries;
- atomic legacy StoredCredential secret reconciliation.

It does **not** yet provide:

- mature Web/Domain/DNS/TLS specialist structures;
- Monitoring checks/results/incidents;
- redesigned KB folder/editor/resource links;
- Docker/Kubernetes specialist structures;
- firewall/load-balancer and other deeper networking specialists;
- final broad technical topology/search polish.

---

## 16. Current technical-operations sequence

1. Website/Domain/DNS/TLS specialist structures;
2. Monitoring checks/history/incidents + technical dashboards;
3. Knowledge Base folder/editor/version/attachment work;
4. KB/resource backlinks + contextual search foundations;
5. Docker/Kubernetes structures;
6. storage/backups/system services/scheduled jobs and remaining specialist operations records;
7. unified topology/search/activity/audit polish;
8. Credential expiry/rotation health and bulk rotation tooling as operational follow-up rather than a blocker for typed Infrastructure.

Client Command Centre integration should continue incrementally as these domains
mature rather than waiting for one giant final integration PR.

Every slice must preserve Client/Internal ownership, capability/scope, current-
first UX, audit boundaries and the Credential Vault secret-handling contract.
